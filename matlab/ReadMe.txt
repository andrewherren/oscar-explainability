Open the OscarExample.m file for an example and full description of the use of the MATLAB code.


The dataset soil.csv contains the 15 predictors (n=20) and the last column is the response (Diversity). 
The analysis in the paper was performed after standardizing each predictor and the response.




The code will automatically return the coefficients for the standardized predictors even if the user did not standardize them prior to calling the procedure.
